 * Class used to define a new way to compare shapes. This gives a different ordering to shapes. The compareTo() in
 * Shape orders shapes in ascending order (comparing area then perimeter).
 *
 * When a sorting function uses this class instead of the compareTo() method in shape, the sorting function
 * will sort the list of shapes in ascending order of area. The perimeter is ignored.
